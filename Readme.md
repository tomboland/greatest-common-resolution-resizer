Just something I've found useful for processing my monochrome L/R/G/B/IR captures after processing in AutoStakkert.  The images can all end up slightly different sizes, and to register and combined them in to a colour image requires them to all be the same size.  Obviously, doing something this basic and simple is beneath PixInsight...
